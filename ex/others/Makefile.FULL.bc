# History:
#
# Experiences compiling the Murphi verifier:
#  There are two things that caused problems in this Muphi release:
#  - Some compilers - especially those based on cfront - can only generate
#   very simple inline code. One has to turn off inlining in this case. The
#   options are typically +d (CC, OCC, DCC) or -fno-default-inline (g++).
#   The compilation is much faster then as well.
#  - The "signal" system call used in Murphi for defining an own handler
#   to catch division by zero seems to be system dependent. Two different
#   ways to use this call can be selected by defining or not-defining
#   CATCH_DIV. See below for when defining CATCH_DIV was needed.
#  - The "sysconf" system function is defined in unistd.h, but Murphi
#   redefines it in mu_verifier.h. On Linux Red Hat 7.1 this causes
#   an error since the redeclared prototype is different from the 
#   original one ("throws different exceptions", as g++ says).
#   Anyway, is seems that on this platform the redeclaration can 
#   be omitted without problems. The definition of SYSCONF_RDCL
#   does this, when the selected platform is Red Hat 7.1 (see below).
#
# Tested on the following machines:
#  beet        SGI INDY    running IRIX 5.3
#  cabbage     Sun SPARC20 running SunOS 4.1.3_U1
#  dawn        Sun SPARC20 running SunOS 5.4
#  elaine      Sun SPARC20 running SunOS 4.1.4
#
# Compiler versions:
#  g++    2.6.0 (cabbage), 2.6.3 (beet), 2.7.2 (dawn, elaine)
#  CC     3.0 or higher (elaine)
#  OCC    3.2.1 (beet)
#  DCC    4.0 (beet)
